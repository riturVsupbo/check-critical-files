CRIMSON METAL REDUX is a sequel to CRIMSON METAL, which was released in 2017. The game follows the story of Adam Crimson, the sole survivor of the Omega squad, who has to go through a series of psychological and physical trials in a secret cyborg and biological-warfare weapon production facility. The game features scores of traps, hundreds of cyborgs, thousands of fierce mutants, and a lot of blood and gore.
  
The game is available on Steam and itch.io for Windows platforms. However, to play the game, you need an activation code and a serial number that are provided by the developers. How can you get them? Here are some possible ways:
  
- Buy the game from Steam or itch.io. This is the easiest and most reliable way to get the activation code and serial number. You will receive them via email or in your account after purchasing the game. The game costs $9.99 on Steam and $4.99 on itch.io.
- Download the demo version from itch.io. The demo version allows you to play the first two levels of the game for free. However, you will still need an activation code and serial number to unlock the full game. You can find them in the setup.ini file in the game folder. You have to change the aspect ratio to match your resolution and enter the code and number manually.
- Search for online generators or cracks. This is not recommended as it may be illegal, unsafe, or unreliable. You may end up with malware, viruses, or fake codes that do not work. Moreover, you may miss out on updates, bug fixes, and support from the developers.

CRIMSON METAL REDUX is a game that will test your skills, reflexes, and nerves. If you are looking for a challenging and intense shooter experience, you should give it a try. Just make sure you have a valid activation code and serial number to enjoy the full game.
